    <p>Philly Cheesesteak with tender ribeye steak, melted gooey provolone, and caramelized onions 
        hugged by a toasted garlic butter hoagie roll. This is the classic way to make a 
        Philly Cheesesteak sandwich!</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One 24-ounce boneless ribeye</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces sweet and hot peppers, sliced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 dense, chewy sandwich loaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt the ribeye, and place on a wire rack in a sheet pan.  
            Freeze for 30 minutes, or until firm to the touch.  With a 
            very sharp knife, slice the ribeye as thin as possible - do not 
            trim off fat.</li>
        <li>In a large cast iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high flame, 
            until shimmering.  Add half the beef in an even layer - donâ€™t 
            overcrowd the pan.  Let beef fry undisturbed for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and 
            crispy.  Flip and continue to fry, until evenly browned and crisp.  Arrange the 
            beef in a long pile in the center of the pan, and top with cheese, reducing heat 
            to medium-low, until cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Split loaf and dress with ketchup and mayo - top with beef and 
            peppers, cut in half, and serve.  Repeat with remaining beef for 
            second sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
